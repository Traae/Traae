# About Me

I'm graduating with a BS in CS from ISU.

At this time I'm looking to start my career in the field. While I'm mostly interested in Software Engineering and Development, I'm interested in learning and trying out almost everything in the field. There's a distinction between what things are like in a school environment as compared to a work environment. So, I'm open to trying new things and getting well rounded understanding of everything in the computing space.
